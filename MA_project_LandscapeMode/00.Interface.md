It is said that an [/ˈɪntəfeɪs/](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interface) is what lays between things, either by connecting or separating them. It's a term commonly use to refer a crucial part of communication between humans and machines, yet for the purpose of this presentation, it will be addressed as an experience extended to any kind of exchange among _personas_ and their surroundings, ranging form a _[[01.Body]]_, a _[[01.Memory]]_, a _[[01.Touch]]_, and, a _[[01.Hardware]]_ perspective. But always focusing on interactive spatial representation and how it relates to _Landscape Mode_ (the horizontality of a screen).
