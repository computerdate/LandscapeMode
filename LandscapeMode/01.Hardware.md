Usually understanded as a tool with a physical presence, it is a tangible _thing_ that stands as a [bridge and door](https://www.tbilisiarchitecture.net/bridge-and-door/) between an intention and an action.

This branch of [[00.Interface]] has been the most highly appreciated since is related to the history of toolmaking, and therefore is entangled with the idea of progress and modernization, heavily dependand on technology and [the resources that make it possible](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GP1MxHVAwNM)

In the computarized world, it's the medium for human-machine comunication and it enables a whole range of outcomes, from [[EVRs]], [^2]which are an inmediate reality that exists around screens, to an [invisible structure](https://anatomyof.ai) than enhances the comfort of daily life task for the price of giving away personal data, speculation around [[Virtual Land]], and even a whole set of _new materialities_[^1]

Depending on the targeted intention, it can be tuned for a specific purpose, that's why on [^4]pc building the use of the machine has to be clear beforehand so both components and desirable workflow are compatibles. That's when _benchmarking_[^3] comes handy, as a tool for simulation a workload in certain scenario.

This has led to a whole new genre of [virtual matches where hardware are compared ad nausea](https://versus.com/en), as the promise for the perfect machine is always ahead.
