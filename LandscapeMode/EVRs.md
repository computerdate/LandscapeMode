Back in 1997, when [[gaming]] wasn't as popular as now, a painter heavily influenced by electronical devices whose primary work are _still life_ images of cables and other electronical [[01.Hardware]], made a manifesto about [Art After Videogames](https://cargocollective.com/manetas/AFTER-VIDEOGAMES/ART-FROM-VIDEOGAMES). On it he stated that this new medium (videogames) were the perfect environment for artist (and developers) to play to be god, as they stand as an expanding dialogue between human will/skill and machine capabilities.

Videogames as the sport of the XXI century, an entertainment industry with a high cultural footprint, are mostly an interactive experience that exists within a console but that has repercussions and depends of the bodies that are outside of it. Where, autonomous beings and improbable objects abound that configure the exploration and colonization of new territories., while retaining a false sense of freedom within a closed system in which virtual sunrises, quad-base landscapes, and NPCs co-habit in a perpetual cycle of idleness.

When adding an interactive agent to the aforementioned panorama, this whole landscape of pixelated leisure turns into something else, an [^1]_expanded version of reality_, where the player actions and the scripted behaviours of the program they are interacting with can led to  shapeshift the current experience of a space. A virtual world is the terrain of the conquest of the future. And current developments on machines as [[Spiritual Vehicles]] and playgrounds for  [[Spatial Intelingence]] proves it.
