Amidst the verge of the new milenia, when cities came overpriced and overcrowded while personal computers more accesible, a new type of space was created, one that despite being framed inside the physical constrains of a computer could enable an endless stream of places and experiences as long there was an electrical outlet nearby.

Traditionally, a landscape is known as an extension of land that is being observed, a cultural construction that shelters a group of beings on a surface, or anything else that acts as an (immersive) representation of nature; But in recent years, with the flourishing of the  computerized world, the invention and exploration of [cyberspace as a territory](https://kitchin.org/atlas/), and the shifting from road movies to walking simulators as a form of mixing storytelling with passive-tourism, have led to a new definition where [^1]“_a landscape is comprised of quads (even squares), followed by sections made of components_”. Then, a contemporary landscape, mediated by current computational devices, would be equivalent to the partition of any surface on a screen. What used to be a territory that stretched as far as the eye can see, today is everything that illuminates us.

In this exploration, one of the rarest and most valuable assets today are websites, [^2]the real estate of this century. The indispensable link between the material and the digital realms, a catchy phrase with a dot in the middle, and a place that can be visited just a couple of clicks away. Some of the reasons they are so rare and valuable are because they can house almost anything, simulate/extend human needs and experiences, name things, and hypothetically make those things come true. After all, they are the window to the world. The more we explore the virtual realms they offer us and interact with the digital beings and objects that inhabit them, the more we learn about ourselves. It is not surprising that this is the way we have chosen to experience the world, with a particular dependence on an almost invisible infrastructure whose last connection to humanity are backlit rectangular black mirrors of variable sizes, also known as screens.

Yet, the possibilty of make a place endless is both a threat and a bless, as it shifted the idea of horizon by taming it and enable it to be render on almost anything, it also poses a new way of commodification around something untouchable yet very present, a [^3][Virtual Land](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsKXpsawVFSSs_TQWWUJ21TRVEGhNJyT8) and its [^4][ new ecology relying on computer graphics](https://hsoderstrom.international/polyecoly.html), which its profitable dimension is questionable.

[^2]:  **Human colonizing activity on earth has had serious moral implications that range from genocides and eradication of entire cultures to the privatization of the ungraspable, but for the first time, the step from three-dimensionality to cyberspace has allowed the conquest, modification, and naming of territories without having to worry about direct victims.
